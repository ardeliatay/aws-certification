# Elastic Compute Cloud

## What is it?
  * _A web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the Cloud( Virtual machine in cloud)_

## EC2 Options

  * **On demand**:
  * _Fixed rate by hour_
  * low cost
  * short term
  * multi-tenant

  * **Reserved**:
  * _Contract (1 or 3 year terms)_
  * apps with steady state or predictable usage
  * can make up-front payments for discount

  * **Spot**:
  * _Bid price_
  * apps that have flexible start and end times

  * **Dedicated hosts**:
  * _physical EC2 server_
  * have your own hardware you work on
  * useful for regulatory requirements

## Instance Types: FIGHT DR MC PX
  * **T**: Web servers/small DBs - lowest cost, general purpose
  * **R**: Memory optimized - memory intensive apps/DBs
  * **M**: App servers - general purpose
  * **C**: Compute optimized - CPU intensive

## What is EBS?
  * _Elastic Block Store_
  * Virtual disk in cloud, allows you to create storage volumes and attach to EC2

### EBS Volume Types
  * **General Purpose SSD**: general purpose, <10,000 IOPS
  * **Provisioned IOPS SSD**: I/O intensive apps, 10,000-20,000 IOPS
  * **Throughput Optimized HDD**: Big data. Can't be boot volume
  * **Cold HDD**: File Servers. Can't be boot volume
  * **Magnetic (standard)**: Legacy. Can be boot volume

## Lab

1. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
2. Choose an Instance Type
3. Configure Instance Details
4. Add Storage
5. Add Tags
6. Configure Security Group
7. Review Instance Launch
8. Connect To Your Instance
  * Either with a standalone SSH client or Java SSH client

`chmod 400 MyKeyPair.pem`
`ssh ec2-user@<IP-address> -i MyKeyPair.pem`
Use key pair to try to connect via ssh via port to EC2 instance

`sudo su`
Admin access

`yum update -y`
Update OS with packages

`yum install httpd -y`
Install apache, turn to web server

`service httpd start`
Start service

`chkconfig httpd on`
If EC2 reboots, apache turns on automatically

`service httpd status`
Shows if apache service is running

## Elastic Load Balancers
* Balance load across multiple different servers

### Types
**Application Load Balancer**
* operates at layer 7 of OSI Layer
* closer to application. Passes through more stuff and is more intelligent
* best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic

**Network Load Balancer**
* operates at layer 4
* fast but costly
* best suited for extreme performance

**Classic Load Balancer**
* sometimes can be called elastic load balancers in exam
* legacy

_Errors_: 504 error - means gateway has timed out.  Troubleshoot at Web Server layer or at DB layer

_X-Forwarded-For Header_
* User's IP address --> Load balancer (private IP) --> EC2 Instance looks for the X-FF Header for public IPv4

## Route 53
* _Amazon's DNS Service_
* Allows you to route your domain names to...
  * EC2 Instances
  * Load Balancers
  * S3 buckets

### Steps
1. Go under network tab and click Route 53
2. Register domain and fill in registrant information
3. Create Hosted Zone
4. Create Record Set

## CLI Demo

## RDS
_Relational Database Service_

### What is it?
* Database - Tables - Rows - Fields (columns)

### Types
* SQL Server
* Oracle
* MySQL Server
* PostgreSQL
* Aurora
* MariaDB

### Background

#### Online Transaction Processing vs. Online Analytics Processing
_differ in terms of the types of queries you will run_
* **OLTP**: Simple transactions that happen frequently. Ex. Order # for online store pulls up row of data such as name, date, address, delivery status etc. RDS is basically OLTP
* **OLAP**: More complex. Pull in large # of records in one query. Ex. Redshift

### Backups
* **Automated Backups**
  * Allow you to recover your DB to any point in time within a "retention period" (between 1-35 days)
  * Takes a full daily snapshot and will also store transaction logs throughout the day
  * When you do a recovery, AWS will choose the most recent daily backup and then apply transaction logs relevant to that day
  * Enabled by default
  * Stored in S3 and you get free storage space equal to the size of your DB
* **Database Snapshots**
  * Done manually
  * Stored even after you delete the original RDS Instance

_Restoring Backups_
* Whenever you do a restore, the restored version of the DB will be a new RDS instance with a new RDS endpoint

### Encryption
_Done using AWS Key Management Service (KMS)_
* Once your RDS instance is encrypted, the date stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted

_Encryption at rest_
What is sitting on a hard drive and not in use

### Multi-AZ RDSA vs Read Replicas
* **Multi-AZ**
  * Allows you to have an exact copy of your production DB in another Availability Zone
  * For Disaster Recovery only.  Not used for improving performance
  * SQL, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
* **Read Replicas**
  * Allow you to have a read-only copy of your production DB
  * Achieved using asynchronous replication from the primary RDS instance to the read replica
  * Used for performance improvement/scaling
  * Must have automatic backups turned on in order to deploy a read replica.  Can have up to 5 read replica copies of any DB
  * Can have read replicas that have Multi-AZ
  * MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Aurora

## Non Relational Databases
* Ex. DynamoDB
* Database - Collection (table) - Document (row) - Key Value Pairs (fields)
* Do not need to pre-define table structure unlike Relational

### Elasticache
_A web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud_
* A way of caching most frequently used queries instead of putting it in your DB
* Supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
  * **Memcached**: Object caching system. Primarily used to alleviate DB load. No persistance
  * **Redis**: Open-source in-memory key-value store that supports advanced data structures like sorted sets and lists(like creating leaderboards)

## Security Groups

### Inbound Rules
_What am I allowed to use?_

_Rules_
* schemes
* port
* source

### Outbound Rules
_What am I allowed to send?_

## Quiz
1. In order to enable encryption at rest using EC2 and EBS, you must _configure encryption when creating the EBS volume_
2. Individual instances are provision _in Availability Zones_
3. New company policy that all EC2 instances must have encryption at rest. What is the quickest and easiest way to apply this policy to your existing EC2 instances? _Create a snapshot of the EC2 volume.  Then create a copy of that volume, checking the box to enable encryption. Create an AMI of the copied snapshot and then redeploy the EC2 instance using the encrypted AMI. Delete the old EC2 instance_
