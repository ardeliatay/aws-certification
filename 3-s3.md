# S3

## The Basics
* Highly-scalable object storage
  * files, images, web pages
  * *not* for databases or OS
* Files can be from 8 Bytes to 5 TB
* Unlimited storage
* Files are stored in Buckets (folders)
* Universal namespace (names must be unique globally)
* Ex. https://s3-us-virginia-1.amazonaws.com/image-bucket
* When you upload a file to S3,  receive HTTP 200 code if upload was successful (when you use CLI or API, _not_ on browser)
* Service is available for 99.99% of the time, but Amazon Guarantee is 99.9% availability
* Also guarantees 99.999999999% durability for s3 information (11 x 9s)
  - guarantees a safe place to store files without loss
* Tiered Storage is available
  -**S3**: suitable for most workloads, 99.99% availability, 11 x 9s durability, stored data redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently
  -**S3-IA** (Infrequently Accessed): for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3 but are charged retrieval fee when you access data
  -**S3-One Zone Ia**: the same as IA but stored in single availability zone only. 11 9s durability but 99.5% availability. Cost is 20% less than regular S3-IA
  -**Reduced Redundancy Storage**: 99.99% durability and availability. Used for data that can be easily recreated if lost (ex. thumbnails)
  -**Glacier**: archiving, very cheap. Used for data that is infrequently accessed as it takes 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier
  -**Intelligent tiering**:
    * Most suitable for unknown or unpredictable access patterns
    * 99.9% availability and 11 9s durability
    * 2 tiers:
      - Frequent and Infrequent access
    * Automatically moves your data to most cost-effective tier based on how frequently you access each object
      - Moves to infrequent tier when object has not been accessed for >30 consecutive days
    * No fees for accessing data but monthly fee for monitoring/automation ($0.0025 per 1000 objects)
* Lifecycle Management**: allows you to set the rules around moving your data between different storage tiers
* Versioning: allowing you to enable version control
* Encryption**: encrypt data to protect from unauthorized access
* Secure your data using access control lists and bucket policies

### Data Consistency Model
1. **Read after Write Consistency** for PUTS of new Objects
  * As soon as you upload, file is available to read straight away
2. **Eventual Consistency** for overwrite PUTS (changes) and DELETES
  * Can take some time to propagate

### S3 is a simple Key-value store
  * Consists of key, value(data), version ID, metadata, subresources (bucket-specific configuration such as Bucket policies and Access Control Lists, CORS, and Transfer Acceleration)

### What do you get charged for?
  * Storage per GB
  * Requests (Get, put etc)
  * Storage Management Pricing
    * Inventory, analytics, object tags
  * Data Management Pricing
    * Charged when data transferred out of S3 (no charge for transferring data _in_)
  * Transfer acceleration
    * CloudFront service that lets you accelerate file transfer speeds when you upload many files into S3

## Securing your Buckets
* By default, all Buckets are private
* Can set up access control to Buckets using
  - **Bucket policies**: applied at bucket level (all the objects in Bucket)
  - **Access Control Lists**: applied at object level (can grant access to individual objects in Bucket)
* Can configure access logs which log all requests made to S3 bucket

## Encryption
### Types of encryption
1. In Transit
  - Encrypting data you are sending to and from your Bucket
  -  Done using SSL/TLS(Transport Layer Security)
2. At Rest
  * Server Side Encryption
    * S3 Management Keys **SSE-S3**
      - each object encrypted with own unique key
      - AWS manages keys
    * AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys **SSE-KMS**
      - AWS manages keys
      - Also get separate permission for Envelope key (additional key that encrypts your data's encryption key), and an audit trail
    * Server side encryption with Customer Provided Keys **SSE-C**
      - AWS manages encryption and decryption but you manage your own keys
  * Client Side encryption
    - You encrypt files yourself before adding to S3

### Enforcing encryption on S3 Buckets
Every time a file is uploaded to S3 a PUT request is initiated.  If the file is to be encrypted at upload time, the **x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter** will be included in the request header

_Two options are available:_
1. **z-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256** (SSE-S3 - S3 managed keys)
2. **z-amz-server-side-encryption: ams:kms** (SSE-KMS - KMS managed keys)

If you want to enforce encryption of your files stored in S3, use an S3 Bucket Policy to deny all PUT requests that do not include the z-amz-server-side-encryption parameter in the request header

## CORS Configuration Lab
* Used to enable cross origin access for your AWS resources (ex. S3 hosted website accessing image files located in another S3 bucket)
* Default is private so to allow this, need to configure CORS on the bucket being accessed and enable access for the origin (bucket) attempting to access
* Always need to use s3 website URL (https://image-bucket.s3-us-virginia-1.amazonaws.com/) and not the bucket URL (https://s3-us-virginia-1.amazonaws.com/image-bucket)

## CloudFront: Amazon's Content Delivery Network

### CDN
A CDN is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server
- a web service which speeds up the distribution of web content

### Basics
**Edge location**: collection of servers which are in geographically dispersed data centers. Used by CloudFront to keep cache of your copies of your object so user makes request directly to edge location rather than main server - faster request times (_note this is different frrom Availability Zone_)

**Origin**: Origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute (can be an S3 Bucket, an EC2 instance, and EBS, or Route53)

**Distribution**: Name of CDN, consists of collection of edge locations
  * **Web Distribution**: typically used for websites, HTTP/HTTPS
  * **Real Time Messaging Protocol**: used for media streaming

### What is CloudFront?
Used to deliver your website, including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to your nearest edge locations

Objects are cached for life of the Time To Live (default is 24 hours). You can clear cached objects manually (invalidation) but you will be charged.

Edge Locations are also used by S3 Transfer Accelerati0on to reduce latency for S3 uploads. Difference between CloudFront and Transfer Acceleration is that CloudFront is focused on content delivery (allowing more efficient reads and downloads) while Transfer Acceleration is focused on enabling faster uploads into S3

## S3 Performance Optimization
May want to optimize if your S3 Buckets are receiving >100 PUT/LIST/DELETE or >300 GET requests per second,

**GET-Intensive Workloads**
Use CloudFront, which will cache your most frequently accessed objects and reduce latency for your GET requests

**Mixed Request Type Workloads**
~~The key names you use for your objects can impact performance. Use of sequential key names (ex. names prefixed with time stamp or alphabetical sequence) increases likelihood of having multiple objects stored within same partition.~~

_NOTE: Performance update from July 2018
* 3500 PUT requests per second and 5500 GET requests
* This negates need to randomize object key names, sequential naming can now be used without any performance implication

## Quiz
1. If you encrypt a bucket on S3, what type of encryption does AWS use? _Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256_

3. How does S3 determine which partition to use to store files? _The key name_
